A] General
Introduction
PACS Broker works as translator between RIS and modality. It translates HL7 data received from
RIS to the DICOM format that modality understands. This way, passing correct data in
respective fields is responsibility of RIS. Broker will not validate the data received (except some
very basic validations) from RIS.
Also, order scheduling is not a part of broker. Order scheduling should be done on RIS and
scheduled orders should be sent to Broker.
Workflow
PACS Broker accepts order (patient demographic, study details and scheduling details) data
from RIS using HL7 specifications. Modality queries the broker (periodically or manually) using
DICOM specifications to fetch this data. On receiving the query from modality, broker provides
matching data to modality. On receiving the data, modalities conduct the study using schedule
information. Modality will then transfer images for conducted study to PACS using DICOM
specifications. After diagnosis, radiologist will generate the report for the study. PACS will
transfer the report to broker. Broker will send the report back to RIS using HL7 specifications.
PACS Broker also accepts the report from RIS using HL7 specifications in case report is
generated on RIS.
Accession number (Placer Order Number) is used as unique identifier for each order. The
accession number should be transferred without any change throughout the integration cycle.

C] Communication protocol and message format
Socket
Message communication will happen though a TCP/IP socket connection to an agreed upon
port and IP address.
There is no asynchronous activity in this implementation. Only one concurrent connection is
allowed on broker. Only one concurrent connection is established by broker.
Bulk messages (multiple messages on single connection) are not supported. Only one message
should be transferred on one connection.
Connection should be immediately closed by RIS when message sending is finished and
acknowledgement is received or timed out.
MLLP Implementation
Broker follows MLLP Specifications. Broker uses the standard HL7 format for messages, thus
starting and ending characters delimit each message.
Description HEX ASCII Symbol
Message starting character 0B 11 <VT>
Message ending characters 1C, 0D 28, 13 <FS>, <CR>
HL7 Delimiter Characters
Description HEX ASCII Symbol
Segment separator character 0D 13 <CR>
Fields separator character 7C 124 |
Component separator character 5E 94 ^
Subcomponent separator character 26 38 &
Field repetition separator 7E 126 ~
Escape character 5C 92 \
The MSH segment of each message contains following identification fields: -
 MSH(3,1) contains sending application.
 MSH(4,1) contains sending facility.
 MSH(5,1) contains receiving application.
 MSH(6,1) contains receiving facility.
 MSH(10,1) contains massage control id. This must be unique for each message including
acknowledgements.
HL7 Version
Broker works on HL7 version 2.3.

Following messages are supported by broker: -
Message Event Path Mandatory
ORM O01 RIS to Broker Yes
ORU R01 RIS to Broker No
Broker to RIS No
ADT A08 RIS to Broker No
ADT A40 RIS to Broker No
a. Order Update (ORM^O01)
An Order Update message is expected from RIS whenever new order is scheduled,
existing order updated, existing order cancelled, existing order is completed. Only one
occurrence of each segment will be permitted in a message.
Example Message

Order Types
Order updating and Order cancellation is supported.
Order type is identified from value of ORC(1,1) field as follows: -
 If value is “NW”, it is new order message.
 If value is “NW”, and accession number (Placer Order Number) already exists in
broker, it is update order message.
 If value is “CA”, it is cancel order message. Order will be deleted from broker
database.
 If value is “CM”, it is complete order message. This order will not be sent to
modality.

b. Report Update (ORU^R01)
A Report Update message is queued when a diagnostic report is added or modified. In
case report is created on RIS, only one occurrence of OBX segment will be permitted in a
message. This is because; PACS support only one report per study.
Example Message
MSH|^~\&|PACS_APP|PACS_FACILITY|HIS_APP|HIS_FACILITY|20130614111345||ORU^R01|MsgCtrlId_O

Report Types
Report cancellation is not supported.
Report updating is supported as follows: -
 If report for received accession number (Placer Order Number) already exists in
broker, it is update report message.
 Otherwise, it is new report message.

c. Admit Discharge Transfer - Patient Information Update (ADT^A08)
A Patient Information Update message is expected from RIS whenever patient
demographic information is updated in RIS.

d. Admit Discharge Transfer - Patient Merge (ADT^A40)
A Patient Merge message is expected from RIS whenever two patient ids are merged on
RIS.
Example Message

E] ORU message details
Encoding characters in report data in ORU message
While reading/writing report data from/to ORU message, encoding characters are mapped with
their respective escape sequences as per HL7 specifications.
Encoding character Mapped with
Segment separator character \X0D\
Fields separator character \F\
Component separator character \S\
Subcomponent separator character \T\
Field repetition separator \R\
New line character (Symbol <LF>; ASCII = 10) \X0A\
Following is an example of report content with encoding characters: -
This is sample report for Xyz^Pqr.
This is an example report only.
Following is example of same report above with mapped encoding characters: -
This is sample report for Xyz\S\Pqr.\X0D\This is an example report only.
Observe that carriage return is replaced with “\X0D\” and “^” is replaced with \S\.
Segment Swapping
While creating ORU message, following segments are swapped from its respective ORM
message: -
 PID
 PV1
 ORC
 OBR
Additional segment OBX is inserted which contains report details.
Report Formats (Broker to RIS)
Report data could be provided to RIS in following formats: -
Format Size Notes
Plain text Small Formatting and images will be lost
RTF text Large Formatting and images will be preserved
Report Formats (RIS to Broker)
Report data could be received from RIS in following formats: -
Format Size Notes
Plain text Small Formatting and images will be lost

F] Acknowledgements
Original Mode HL7 Acknowledgement is supported and mandatory. Both the 15th and 16th
fields of the MSH segment of the out-bound messages will be empty. In case of in-bound
messages, these fields will NOT be checked.
Broker only sends the acknowledgement when processing is finished.
Broker will always send acknowledgement (success or failure) to RIS with the reason for failure
if any. Similarly, broker will always wait for acknowledgement (success or failure) from RIS.
Acknowledgements are communicated to the random port on same connection.
Broker does the following when it encounters a message that has been queued for broadcast:
 It attempts to establish a socket connection to the RIS
 It sends the message
 It waits for an acknowledgement
If an acknowledgement is not received within the specified time-out interval, then the above
cycle is repeated. When positive acknowledgement (ACK) is received for a message that has just
been sent, the broker removes the message from the outgoing queue, and proceeds to the next
message on the queue.
If negative acknowledgement (NAK) is received from RIS, the event is logged and broker
removes the message from the outgoing queue, and proceeds to the next message on the
queue.
Following is the example ACK message Broker will send against received ORM message: -
MSH|^~\&|PACS_APP|PACS_FACILITY|HIS_APP|HIS_FACILITY|20130614105253||ACK^O01|MsgCtrlId_ACK|P|2.
3|1||||91|||
MSA|AA|MsgCtrlId_ORM|Order registered.|||
ACK types
ACK type is identified from value of MSA(1,1) field as follows: -
 AA – Application Accept – Message is successfully processed and accepted on Broker.
 AR – Application Reject – Message is successfully processed on Broker but rejected. Read
the reason and resend the message after correction.
 AE – Application Error – Broker is failed to process the message.
